This never had a chance to be implemented, but the idea was to have one singular landing page (instead of three, in this case) that had 95% identical information, but the offer block would change based on the UTM parameter. That way, we could serve ads for a specific offer with that UTM parameter, and a customer would see the appropriate offer. I'm proud of this because it saved having to duplicate the same page multiple times and just swapped out the offer block accordingly.

This is an announcement bar that would count down each day to create a sense of urgency for a sale (typically a % off the entire order). The desire was for this to have a countdown that would seem like the sale was for a much shorter time period than it really was, to drive the customer towards a purchase decision. I can't say I'm proud of the deceptiveness of the countdown, but marketing is like that at times, and I'm proud of being able to deliver solutions that enable others to do their jobs well.

This is a css3 animation for a local brewery's website. I really love how this turned out and it was a lot of fun finding something that I thought would look great and then researching how to make it a reality. Using svg's and only css was the icing on the cake as it requires no JS at all. It can be seen in action at https://elevenlakesbrewing.com/our-beer/.
